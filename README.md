Problem: 
Given two queues with their standard operations(enqueue,dequeue,isempty,size), implement a stack with its standard operations(pop,push,isempty,size). 

C++: 
Objectives:
1.) Implement functions outlined in stack.cpp and pass test outlined in main. \  
2.) Add a success message if all test pass\
3.) finish dockerfile to create an image that builds and runs application.\
4.) Create a README.md to instruct user on how to build and run container. \

Python:
Objectives: 
1.) Implement functions outlined in stack.py \
2.) Create test for 100% code covereage. Write out success message if all test are past. \
3.) Finish dockerfile to create an image taht runs the stack.py\
4.) Create a README.md to instruct a user on how to build and run container. \
